This guide assists Maldives resorts using OPERA Cloud PMS in generating and exporting Greentax reports by first configuring the report settings, including the date range, tax codes, and resort details, then generating and reviewing the report for accuracy. Once verified, the report can be exported in the desired format (e.g., Excel, CSV, or PDF) and submitted to the relevant authorities. To ensure smooth reporting, keep the system updated, train staff, and periodically audit the process for compliance with local regulations. For further assistance, consult the OPERA Cloud user manual or support team.
